# ChatDB on MySQL Database

DSCI 551 Semester Project

Qianshu Peng (ChatDB 87 Group)

This is the documentation of ChatDB. Please find the instructions of running this project below.

## Execute ChatDB

Before executing, please make sure you have these modules installed in your environment:
- pandas
- pymysql
- nltk

Also, you need to have MySQL server on your computer to connect to ChatDB. It's recommended to use Python 3.6, and other versions of Python are possible to cause error or incorrect results. 

In your terminal, enter: <br>
<code>python main.py</code> <br>
If <code>python</code> does not work for you, try <code>python3</code> or other commands corresponding to your python version.

If this is your first time of executing ChatDB, enter your MySQL host, username, and password to connect to local MySQL server; otherwise, the configurations will be loaded automatically. Also, the nltk package will download the resources it needs. 

Then you will enter the ChatDB interface. Follow the instructions on the interface to continue. If you get any error message, please check if your environment fulfills all requirements above. 

Notice: if you have run the ChatDB, you may get several error messages like <code>Error creating table or inserting data: (1050, "Table already exists")</code>, since built-in database has been created. This will not affect use, and you can simply **ignore them**.
